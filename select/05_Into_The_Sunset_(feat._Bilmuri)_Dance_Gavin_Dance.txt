Surrender
Surrender
My walls melt in your gaze
Your sunshine clears the haze
Surrender
Am I good enough?
For your love
Make me believe that everything is good
Don't shoot a hole up in the sun
Turn it to gold and make it happy again
I feel it cut on my teeth
Don't let it shatter all around me
Do you really want to stay?
Do you really want to stay?
Do you even know you've lost yourself?
Walking cliche
Do you really want to stay?
Do you really want to stay?
Do you even know you've lost yourself?
Are you okay?
Ohh awesome
They're pimpin out the poorest
Forget about some forest
Ignore it
We're either getting saved or getting fucked
The quantum shit they're building man
You can't even understand
The possibilities are dropping in
Stick around get stuck
Stick around get stuck
You're a clown now, you're a clown now
Stick around get stuck
Stick around get stuck
Stick around get stuck
You're a clown now, you're a clown now
Stick around get stuck
Climb that ladder
Ass don't matter
Drip mad hatter
Watch it burn
Brew the earth up and put it in an urn
Light that bitch up
Spin it watch it turn
Feels good to be the last generation
Cuttin' xans in a space station
I'm not fuckin' cryin' while I'm waitin'
Let world end nigga I'm patient
Do you really want to stay?
Do you really want to stay?
Do you even know you've lost yourself?
Walking cliche
Do you really want to stay?
Do you really want to stay?
Do you even know you've lost yourself?
Are you okay?
The future no one's famous
We're just a giant ass
Cheeks are made of children
Old was just a fad
Shit on all the billions
Version stupid crap
Hive named D.Y.L.A.N.
Don't you love a nap
Stick around get stuck
Stick around get stuck
You're a clown now, you're a clown now
Stick around get stuck
Stick around get stuck
Stick around get stuck
You're a clown now, you're a clown now
Stick around get stuck
Leaving the world behind
Happiness undefined
Leaving the world behind
You're a clown now, you're a clown now
Stick around get stuck
