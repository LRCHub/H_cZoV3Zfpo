The rays of sunlight
Make my eyes turn wide
Just look at the sky
Yesterday you came
And tomorrow's the same
It's you
The one I remember

The time flies by
When we burn inside
So we hold on tonight
The waves crash in
When it finally ends
It's here
Is this really over

You are my everything
My everything
My everything
You are my everything to me

It seems so long
Since you've been gone
It all feels wrong in December
I'll wait right here
Until next year
For you
I hope you remember

The time flies by
When we burn inside
So we hold on tonight
The waves crash in
When it finally ends
It's here
Is this really over

Just take my hand
We'll be right back
It's love tonight
In the sunrise

You are my everything
My everything
My everything
You are my everything to me
