Along the green water
The soldier sang spring moons away
And the soldier had a brother who ran
And he's calling out for blossoms

Blame the way the sky looked
When those planes fell down
The ground the nines, by tens...
There is beginning and another, again and again

We won't rest here by the hour
Only weightless when you let them

So measure, measure on
And feel the way I thought of you tonight
From so many miles away
Across time and reach of the engines and the furies
Sunset damage by the mouthful

The others hardly heard them
They kept traveling in circles and
Drifted back in to seven notches above
"The top of the world" you called it

Set the towers on fire
Just to feel the space beyond
You won't rest again here
Burn up the hours, collect them by the pound

And you won't know how it goes down
And we won't know how it goes down
Falling back to water
