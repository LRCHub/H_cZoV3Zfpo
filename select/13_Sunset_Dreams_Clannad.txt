Covered in darkness a time that is past
Waiting adrift they cannot hold back
Cannot hold back
Tear misted eyes standing alone
A broken will over all that they've known

Out in the distance far is the calling
Shadows still steal
Through the place that they knew
A vision that's empty is what they see
The eyes of tomorrow
Look to sunset dreams

Sorrow deepens only to tell
That silence speaks where words cannot mend
Words cannot mend
A vision that's empty is what they see
The eyes of tomorrow
Look to sunset dreams

Out in the distance far is the calling
Shadows still steal
Through the place that they knew
A vision that's empty is what they see
The eyes of tomorrow
Look to sunset dreams

Covered in darkness a time that is past
Waiting adrift they cannot hold back
Cannot hold back
Tear misted eyes standing alone
A broken will over all that they've known

Out in the distance far is the calling
Shadows still steal
Through the place that they knew
A vision that's empty is what they see
The eyes of tomorrow
Look to sunset dreams
