Earthquake in new york city,
The chrysler building fell in my yard
But when the shit hits the fan,
I think I'll have to make my way
Back to sunset boulevard
The ira has just hit london,
They blew up half of scotland yard
But when the shit hits the fan,

I guess I'll try to make my way
Back to sunset boulevard
Cruisin' down a mountain highway,
Someone's cut the brakes on my car
But when the shit hits the fan,
I know I have to get my ass
Back to sunset boulevard
