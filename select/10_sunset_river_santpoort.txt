I don't know if I want to be around
If our future doesn't fit
I don't know if there's going to be tomorrow
If it finds out what we done to it
You just be yourself
That's what nature has given to you
Don't go copy anyone else
Let it all just flow out of you
Why don't you just fly on the sunset river, beautiful sky
It's a beautiful sky
You can try to get away
You can try to get away
You can try to get away
You can try to get away

Why don't you just fly on the sunset river, beautiful sky
The beautiful sky
You can try to get away
You can try to get away
You can try to get away
You can try to get away
