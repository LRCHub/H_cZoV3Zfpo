There is only one way
Before you stand up
The only one unknown
Don't be blinded by it
Things can be better than now
Now look up at me
No one ever cared about you
Act like you mean it
The enemies lay behind the door
When you are doing great
I turned on the TV when I could,
But no one never thinks of me
A man is nothing unless he does
what he really wants
Don't worry, they won't pay
attention to you as yourself
Let them see the lies build
There is only one way
Before you stand up
The only one unknown
Don't be blinded by it
Things can be better than now
To link all the pieces of
memories
The same mistakes are committed
Escape from the space between
the lies
To reach where we stand now
There is only one way
Before you stand up
The only one unknown
Don't be blinded by it
Things can be better than now
